# newLISP-Tk
An attempt to build an interface from newLISP to a small subset of Tcl/Tk. 

It's an experimental interface, designed to build Tcl/Tk GUIs controlled from newLISP, similar to pythonâ€™s tkinter. It uses newLISPs FOOP-Classes to describe the widgets being used in the GUI.

The only Tcl/Tk geometry-manager available here is GRID.  It is a small subset of what Tcl/Tk offers, when building a GUI. Work is still under way.

The interface described has been built and tested so far, using Linux (LMDE6 with the cinnamon desktop) as the underlying operating system.
